# aurelia-bootstrapper-meteor

This library is not an official part of the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform and contains a bootstrapper, for use with Meteor, which sets up the default configuration for the Aurelia framework and gets you up and running quick and easy.

You have to add a meteor plugin to load html files as static files. It will be published very soon.
